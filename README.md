"test":
  ![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grebnafets/cset/master/test/images/demo.valid.1.jpg)
  "test" function is basically assert function on steroid. Node that ansi escape codes are used for detailed display.
  The function has several modes, namely:
    1 -> display failure
    2 -> display success
    4 -> display results
  You can then use combo of any of the three flags, just like with linux permissions. 7 displays all three like the
  shows.
