# cset
##Small C toy projects, my C playground. (take 2).


---

## How to build.
export environment variable CSET_SEARCH_PATH so makefile within build
directory won't break.

example: (in .bashrc under Linux.)

    export CSET_SEARCH_PATH=path_to_downloaded_git_repo

Let me know if there are any issues.

## Navigation
cset/[project name]/main.c will contain "how to use". In the future it will
also contain tests for other projects I might play with in the future.

## Keep in mind
That nothing is holy here. I might scratch the whole thing out of whim only
to start again. This is simply my playground. Nothing more and nothing less.
