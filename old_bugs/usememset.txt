This actually might not have happen in the source, but it is still generally
valid.

Using memset means you can take safety measures, like for threads and forks.

String termination such as foo[len] = '\0'; will effectively make it very hard
to make any possible precautions later on.
There are number of ways to optimize later that involve removal and
relocations of locks.

I intent; over time, to define the set of non-rentry. The hope is to automate
synchornization via internal router.

P.S.
This wasn't thought of from the very beginning and there might be string
termination in the source :( (sorry...)
Feel free to replace string termination with memset if you find one in the
source. These kinds of patches will be accepted to the main branch even if it
only envolves one character!
