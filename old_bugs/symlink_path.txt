Do not to use ${CSET_SEARCH_PATH} for symlink path.
It is better to use relative path if possible for symlinks.

It is o.k for a makefile because the path is resolved everytime.
This should make it less painful to get the source base to work
on other machines the first time.

This is not a dictating solution. If there are still a problems on
installation then another solution would need to be found.

Another solution is to make .gitignore hide symlinks and use a script
to automatically create them.
